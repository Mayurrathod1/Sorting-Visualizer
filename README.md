# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is an interactive tool to showcase the inner workings of various sorting algorithms. This visualization tool provides an educational and intuitive way to understand how sorting algorithms function step-by-step.

## Implemented Algorithms
The following sorting algorithms are implemented in this visualizer:
1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Selection Sort**
3. **Insertion Sort**
4. **Merge Sort**
5. **Quick Sort**
6. **Heap Sort**

## Features
### 1. Visual Representation
The visualizer uses color codes to represent different steps of the sorting process:
- **Blue**: Default state of the element.
- **Yellow**: Elements being compared.
- **Red**: Elements identified as in the incorrect position and need to be moved.
- **Green**: Elements in their correct position.

### 2. Controls for Customization
The tool includes three main controls for enhanced interactivity:
1. **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of visualization with 5 different speed levels.
2. **Data Size**: Modify the number of elements in the dataset.
3. **Generate New Data**: Generate a new dataset with randomly assigned values.

### 3. Algorithm Complexity
The tool displays the **Time Complexity** and **Space Complexity** of the currently selected sorting algorithm for better understanding.
